# User-Profile-Validation-System
Here we will see if the user profile is valid or not by checking full name, mobile number, email id and age.
User Profile Validation System
📌 Project Overview
The User Profile Validation System is a simple Python program designed for a university web portal.
Before saving a user’s profile, the system validates the entered details based on predefined rules.
This project demonstrates the use of:
Python data types
Conditional statements
String manipulation
Input validation
🧩 Problem Statement
The program takes the following inputs from the user:
Full Name (string)
Email ID (string)
Mobile Number (string)
Age (integer)
Based on specific validation rules, the program determines whether the user profile is VALID or INVALID.
✅ Validation Rules
1. Full Name
Must contain at least two words
Must not start or end with a space
2. Email ID
Must contain ‘@’ and ‘.’
‘@’ must not be the first character
3. Mobile Number
Must be exactly 10 characters
Must contain only digits
Must not start with 0
4. Age
Must be between 18 and 60 (inclusive)
🖥️ Expected Output
If all validations pass:
User Profile is VALID
If any validation fails:
User Profile is INVALID
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3
Basic input/output
Conditional logic
